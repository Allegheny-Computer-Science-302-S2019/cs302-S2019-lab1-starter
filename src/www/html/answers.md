# A Web Site Created by Gregory M. Kapfhammer

I am learning more about how to apply styles and to run servers. Please provide
a reference to the Pandoc manual and the GitHub repository containing the
Markdown styles. You can review the assignment sheet for more details.

## Explain and show all of the commands you typed to convert to HTML.

Please explain the steps that you used to perform both conversions. You must
introduce the commands first and then used fenced code blocks to give the
commands. The commands must be included in the following fenced code blocks.

## Find at least one code block inside of a CSS file and try to explain it.

Please find a segment of code in a provided CSS file and explain it in detail.
If there are parts of the CSS code segment that you do not understand, that is
fine &mdash; you should point out what is unclear and then speculate about what
you think it does. If you are interested in doing so, please consider reading
ahead in the textbook to learn more about CSS. You should give the name of the file in an inline code block. Finally, you should also include
the entire code segment in a fenced code block.

## How does your server return the HTML and CSS file(s) to the client?

Please explain all relevant details about the server's use of HTML and CSS. You
will need to carefully inspect the source code of the input and generated files
to learn more about the storage location of the CSS rules.

## What error code does the server return when it can or cannot find a file?

Please refer to the codes that are in Table 2.1 of the textbook. Don't forget to
show the server's output in a fenced code block. Your chosen code segment should
highlight exactly what the error code is when you try to access a file that does
not currently exist on the web server.

## Create a table that summarizes the meaning of at least five error codes.

The following table should include your own intuitive description of at least
three error codes. You should give the error code, and its meaning and then
explain when the server would return that error code. Your table should have the
same format as the one in Table 2.1 on page 61 of your textbook.
